Quiz App using JavaFX and JDBC is a dynamic, GUI-based quiz application built with JavaFX for the frontend and JDBC for backend database connectivity. This project allows users to take a 10-question general knowledge quiz, tracks their performance in real-time, and displays results with a sleek, animated result page.

The application features custom-designed JavaFX UI components ‚Äî modern buttons, styled labels, and animated progress indicators ‚Äî giving it a polished and professional feel. It includes user interaction handling, score tracking, and a personalized result message based on performance.

On the backend, the app leverages JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to manage and store user-related data such as quiz scores, login/logout actions, or even user registration if extended. This makes the project highly scalable and ready for integration with real-world systems like learning platforms or classroom assessments.

A logout button resets the session and returns the user to the login/signup screen, making it ideal for multi-user workflows. The codebase follows clean architecture principles with well-structured controllers and FXML separation.

Whether you‚Äôre learning JavaFX UI development or implementing JDBC in a desktop application, this project provides a solid foundation for building interactive, database-driven apps.
